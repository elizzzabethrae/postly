# postly
a comment platform for users

This platform is based on a 'facebook wall'. Any user could post to a wall and talk back and forth between other users.

Since this is a coding challenge, this is what I was able to complete in 2 hours. It is unfinished, but off to a good start!

Things I would continue to work on would be: 
1. Fix error on creating new posts
2. Establish 'users' and user profiles.
3. Add policies to establish rules and what users can and can't do
4. Create unique user walls for posting to 

There is a ton more I could do, the possibilities are endless!
